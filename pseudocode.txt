building a password Generator (RANDOM)




variables -->
passwordLength
confirms

var specialChars = ["+", "!", "#"]



when the user clicks the generate password button --> how many characters would you like?

we know confirms store boolean values!! 

confirm to ask user if they would like special characters --> confirm 

confirm to ask user if they would like numerical characters --> confirm

confirm to ask user if they would like lowercase characters --> confirm

confirm to ask user if they would like uppercase characters --> confirm



how am i gonna build this?

create function called generatePassword
we are gong to need to use math.floor(), Math.random() functions


var specialChars = ["+", "!", "#"]
var numericChars = ["1", "2", "3",];


we have the user input for char length, we have confirms of what chars they want in the Password

---> now how do we generate a random password based on the length the user wants and the characters they chose
